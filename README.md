# final-project-starter-code
Almost all of the code was written together while sitting next to each other in Victorâ€™s room. 

Individually, Umarbek implemented the scrollama (story board scrolling animations) and wrote the paper while Victor completed the data engineering. Umarbek also wrote the essay. The most difficult aspect of the project development process was in implementing the logic for selection/update on the bar charts. 

Initially, we were interested in exploring just Boston crime, such as the time series of crime incidents. However, while doing more research into crime data and Boston's neighborhood demographics and history, we realized that there was a much more important message to convey in our visualization. Thus, before our MVP, we decided to shift our focus towards the correlation between crime and resource inequity in Boston's neighborhoods. To fully convey this narrative, we used a story board where we guided the user through key crime and demographics findings, while allowing them to explore some of the data.

Overall, Umarbek spent 75 hours and Victor spent 69 hours, for a combined total of 144 hours spent on this visualization. For each person, 60 of these hours were spent either planning or pair programming together.
