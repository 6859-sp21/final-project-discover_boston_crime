                <p>Boston has a history of segregation due to discriminatory housing policies from the pre-civil war era. In fact, out of the country’s 51 greater metropolitan areas with large Black populations, it ranks 15th for segregation. There also exists inequities and income segregation across Boston neighborhoods. A 2015 study conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston revealed that a white household’s median net worth is $247,000 whereas in an African American's household, it is $8. In addition, different Boston neighborhoods are also affected by crimes in various ways. While some experience more overall crime, other neighborhoods are more susceptible to severe crime types such assault. As a result, we seek to understand the correlation between crime and demographics of Boston’s neighborhoods through a scrolly-board, martini visualization. We hope that our visualization reveals how Boston’s history continues to affect the lives of its residents today.</p>
